<p> The speech class I took was online through WITC for college credit. It was kind of 
interesting to take a speech class online and watch other people's speeches. What we did 
in this class was create about seven different speeches.To prepare for them, we read the 
chapters out of our textbook, as well as did outlines and notecards. Once this was 
complete, we needed to have a live audience of at least four adults, so they could 
complete a feedback form, in which you would show at the beginning and end of the 
recording of your speech. Afterwards, we would always have another person's speech to look 
over and give feedback to as well.
