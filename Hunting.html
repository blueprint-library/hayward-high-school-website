<p>  I've been brought up in a family where we were taught about the beauty of nature by 
being outdoors. Starting out life, I was always intrigued when my dad came home with a 
big buck, any ducks, or pheasants. I've been taught to appreciate all of the God given 
natural resources that we are given through hunting.
