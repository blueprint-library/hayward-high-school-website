<p> Golf is something I sort of picked up on my own when I was younger. I would always hit 
balls in the backyard at our old house, but nothing to serious. When we moved up 
to Hayward from IL, a few summers later I heard about a golf clinic Hayward Golf was 
hosting for little kids and I remembered thinking that sounds like fun, lets give it a 
shot. Since then I've been apart of the golf team all through highschool and received four
varsity letters. I've also been fortunate enough to be apart of the state tournament the 
past four years, that was held three of my years at University Ridge, and one year at 
Cherokee Country Club.
