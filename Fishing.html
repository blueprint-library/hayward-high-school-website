<p> Fly fishing has become my true passion.  When I was younger, I had went to an outdoor day and they taught us how to cast 
a fly rod, and I thought it was the cooles thing! Going home I was really excited about
fly fishing. I talked to my dad about it, and I found out he had an old fly rod from when 
he did a lot of fly fishing. I picked it up and never put it down since.
