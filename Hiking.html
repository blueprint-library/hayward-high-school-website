<p> Being with nature is something that I feel is always relaxing. Going hiking get you 
moving and keeps you active, is relaxing, and interesting since you never know what you
might find! Whether you hike into a patch or morel mushrooms, or stumble across a pair of 
shed antlers, to finding an old abandoned car, every step is a new adventure to take. And
it's something you'll never want to miss out on.
