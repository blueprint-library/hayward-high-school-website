<p> My Intro to American Government class I took was through online through WITC for 
college credit. In it we read out of our textbook, as well as did discussion board 
assignments, written assignments,tests and quizzes. There were about 15 other students in 
my class. Overall, taking this class was something I really enjoyed.
