<p> My Intro to American Government class I took was through online through WITC for college credit. In it we read out of our 
textbook, as well as did discussion board assignments, written assignments, tests and quizzes. My instructor was ___ and there 
were about 15 other students in my class. Overall, taking this class was something I really enjoyed.
