<p> Calculus, in my opinion, was my most challenging class. I really enjoy math and am 
overall very happy that I chose to take this class and get college credit through UW 
Superior. Not only do I feel that this class will help me with my math skills, but also 
with study and work habits I gained along the way. In Calculus, the main study is all 
about derivatives. It seems as though all year we worked toward taking the derivative and 
anti-derivative of equations.
