<image src="rachelpic.jpg" height="450" width="700"> <br>
<p> My name is Rachel. I was originally born in McHenry, IL and moved to Hayward in third
grade, which I'm very thankful for. Growing up in Hayward has been quite a blessing for
it's really formed who I've become today. I have one older sister who is married with
three kids. Mary is 5, Elizabeth is 3, and Abraham is 2, with one more little boy on the 
way. I'm a very family oriented person and really enjoy being an Auntie to three great
kids. The past year I was fortunate enough to have won the 2015 Musky Queen title. This 
has been a great opportunity to represent such a wonderful community. With being a 
graduating senior at Hayward High School, I will be continuing my education at 
UW River Falls, majoring in biology and being apart of the girls golf team. I hope you 
enjoy my webpage!
